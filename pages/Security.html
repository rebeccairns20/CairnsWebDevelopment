        <p id="articleTitle">But What About Hackers?</p>
        <p id="article body"> How can a website be protect against hackers and
          viruses?  The news reports hackers attacking governments and billion
          dollar corporations regularly.  In a world where power and money can’t
          guarantee cyber security how can anyone maintain a secure web presence?
          Well, it’s complicated but there are some practices to safeguard.
          <br/><br/>
          1.  Update Immediately<br/><br/>
          Regularly updating and maintaining software is one of the easiest and
          most important ways to fight off a malicious attack.  When a threat
          is found and a solution programmed by developers the new update to
          protect users are available through updates.  Sure, updates seem to
          pop up at the worst moments but these updates have critical
          information developed to protect users from hackers.  Cairns Web
          Development offers maintenance options as well as options for
          individuals to regularly update software as needed.<br/><br/>
          2.  Use SSLR<br/><br/>
          In a nutshell https is a version of the http usually found at the
          beginning or a website in the address bar.  Using an SSLR is a
          somewhat involved process and is therefore best to be implemented at
          the time of setup.  Most SSLRs cost an annual fee of about $30 a year
          but are worth their weight in gold.  SSLRs are an absolute must for
          any websites implementing eCommerce or using any sensitive
          information.  All websites developed by Cairns Web Development are
          automatically built with a SSLR and the maintenance costs are lumped
          into TCO, total cost of ownership, proposals.<br/><br/>
          3.  Using Reputable Plugins or APIs<br/><br/>
          This is a complicated topic for any non Techie to understand.
          Plugins and APIs are code written into websites to interface with
          3rd party in order to use their information or functions.  Don’t
          wory if that confuses you.  These are complicated issues in which
          experience and research make a huge difference in the ability of a
          Web Developer to use and implement the most secure plugins and APIs.
          A developers ability to investigate and design a website that is very
          secure reflects competency, knowledge, and experience.  This is why
          using a quality Web Developer, Like Cairns Web Development, is an
          essential safeguard against hackers.<br/><br/>
          4. Maintain Websites<br/><br/>
          Regular maintenance is a CRITICAL requirement for every website.
          Through the use of CMSs, Content Management Solutions like Wordpress,
          customers can do many of the regular maintenance requirements with
          very little training or technical skills.  Regular checkups with a
          professional would be necessary but less frequently.  Cairns Web
          Development offers regular maintenance as a service.  Maintaining and
          monitoring websites is a critical part of maintaining a website either
          by a professional or owner using a CMS.
