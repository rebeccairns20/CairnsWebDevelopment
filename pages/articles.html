        <p id="articleTitle">Rethinking WordPress</p>
        <p id="articlebody">   Does WordPress make you think of poorly designed
          websites with slow load times and clunky features?  That is
          understandable.  Because WordPress was built to be so easy anyone can
          use it, anyone with any skill set has used it.  The internet is
          littered with hodgepodged unfinished Wordpress Sites.  That being said
           the takeaway that having a WordPress website means it’s cheap or a
           bad websites is an unfair conclusion that could cost customers money
           and functionality.<br/><br/>   Wordpress is the largest and best known CMS,
           Content Management Solution.  A Content Management Solution is
           basically the software used by the websites owner to update
           information.  For example, if a writer wants to be able to add blog
           posts to their website, that writer would want to use a Content
           Management System.  Without a CMS this writer would be forced to pay
           a web developer weekly to add the code to a static page.
           Alternatively if that writer couldn’t pay a web developer every week,
            that writer would have to learn programming and write code for ever
            blog.  Updating blogs would become extremely time consuming and
            expensive, not to mention a headache. <br/> <br/>  Another solution web
            developers offer clients is a custom Content Management Solution.
            These take a lot of time to make and cost a lot of money.  Web
            Developers are literally reinventing the wheel as they reprogram a
            costly custom CMS.  For a large business like Walmart or Amazon
            thousands upon thousands of dollars is a drop in the bucket but for
            anyone less than a multi-billion dollar company pre-built Content
            Management Solutions offer a free, maintained, easy to use,
            immediate solution.<br/> <br/>  Does having a WordPress website mean your
            website is cheap or clunky or hurt your business?  Well that
            depends.  This is where a lot of businesses get themselves in
            trouble because quality and experience show.  Hiring a professional
            and optimizing online presence through a quality website geared to
            promote business will improve brands.  Cutting costs with free or
            inexperienced web developers hurts brands.<br/><br/>   WordPress isn’t for
            everyone, but it is for someone.  For any non programmer who needs
            to work with their website after the website is completed, WordPress
            is a wonderful option.  It’s free and easy to use.  As long as the
            website is developed and maintained professionally by an experienced
            web developer, use WordPress.
